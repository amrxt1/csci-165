        I am 19 and I am a Computer Science student at Columbia College Vancouver. I recently moved here, just a month
        ago to be specific. I have a little brother, 4 years old, who has been really missing me since I got here. Also,
        I
        like to push myself to the limits. Therefore, I took the classes everyone told me not to take. Everything is
        going good so far.That's all for now. Come back for more updates.

    <p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
