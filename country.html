    <p>
        India, a vibrant tapestry of culture, history, and diversity, is a land that never fails to captivate the heart.
        From the bustling streets of Delhi to the tranquil backwaters of Kerala, this country offers an enchanting blend
        of tradition and modernity. With a population as diverse as its landscapes, India's rich heritage is reflected
        in its festivals, cuisine, and architecture. Its ancient temples and majestic palaces stand as a testament to
        the grandeur of its past, while its burgeoning tech industry and dynamic youth population symbolize its
        promising future. Despite its challenges, India's resilience and spirit shine through, making it a country
        filled with endless opportunities and endless stories waiting to be discovered.

        <h3>Panjab</h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        I come from the state of Panjab. Although it is written officially as "Punjab", it is the wrong way. The correct
        way to write it,the way to make the correct pronounciation 'obvious' is Panjab. Agriculture is the main
        occupation of people living there, including my family. There used to be a variety of crops grown there however,
        people have settled on the two main crops of rice and wheat nowadays.
