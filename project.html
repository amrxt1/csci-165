        <span class="bold-big">Linux</span> is a family of free and open-source
        operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on
        Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include
        Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

        The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has
        proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers
        that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from
        web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and
        74% of the world’s smartphones are powered by Linux.

      <p>
        The terms “terminal,” “shell,” and “command line interface” are often
        used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them:

      <ul id="list-dot">
        <li>
          A terminal is an input and output environment that presents a
          text-only window running a shell.
        </li>
        <li>
          A shell is a program that exposes the computer’s operating system to a
          user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal
          is a command line interpreter.
        </li>
        <li>
          A command line interface is a user interface (managed by a command
          line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer
          program and outputs the results.

      <ul id="security">
        <li>
          <span class="list-heading">User Permissions</span><br />
          When you install Windows, it will create an administrator account and
          give you full access to do basically whatever you want with the
          operating system using the magical “Run as administrator” option.
          Linux, on the other hand, doesn’t allow such permissions by default,
          it will allow you to use your home directory freely, but whenever you
          want to do a system-level operation you need to provide the root
          password.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-heading">Software installation </span><br />
          To install software on Windows, users generally go to the internet,
          search for an EXE or MSI file, download it and install it. This is a
          huge security risk since you never know if this source can be trusted
          or not. Linux on the other hand uses something called package
          managers. To put it simply, a package manager is responsible for
          downloading the programs you need from trusty sources called
          repositories. Repositories are usually managed by the community, and
          packages take a long process to get verified and accepted. They also
          make things easier for the user, since there is no search on the
          internet nor any lookup for download files, all you have to do is
          enter a simple command.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-heading">Open Source </span><br />
          Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that the source
          code for it is available for anyone to see and modify, you can even
          create your personal Linux distribution and commercialize it if you
          want and nobody will stop you. At first, you might think that this is
          a security risk since bad people can look at the code. But the
          benefits outweigh the risks in this case. Since even more, developers
          and researchers all over the world find bugs and exploits and send
          patches almost every day to the Linux source code, which makes it
          safer and more secure over time. In contrast, Windows is proprietary
          software owned by Microsoft, and no matter how many talented
          developers Microsoft hires, finding exploits will never be as fast as
          in Linux since there is a big community behind it.
